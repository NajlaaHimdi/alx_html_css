            <h1>HTML HISTORY</h1>
            <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many 
                different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which 
                became an official standard in December 1999. Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML 
                as an XML language</p>

            The best way to learn HTML is with guided practice. It can be in a boot camp (in-person or online)
             or with guided modules.A module provides a mix of video instruction, lectures, and guided practice. 
            Some even have a test that you take at the end of each lesson.Modules are practical 
            because they enable students to learn at their own pace and take a hands-on approach to the lesson
            The most critical first step in your HTML education journey is selecting the right program that works
            for you.There are so many different programs on the market. You should find the one that fits your learning
            style and commit to it. Below, we've outlined some of the best free HTML resources you can use in your study

        <p>Ernest Hemingway's quote, "The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places"
             is a powerful statement that speaks to the universal human experience of facing adversity and overcoming

            <img src="1200px-CSS.3.svg.png" alt="CSS.LOGO" height="25%" width="20%">
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
                 colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility 
                 and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                  formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and 
                  repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached
                 to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>

            <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
            <img src="JavaScript-Logo.png" alt="JAVASCRIPT.LOGO" height="25%" width="20%">
            <p>JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
                 technologies
                 of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript
                  on the client
                  side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries.
                 All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for 
                working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

            <h3>PYTHON</h3>
            <img src="téléchargement.png" alt="PYTHON LOGO">
            <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
                 Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it
                  very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language
                   to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability
                    and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages,
                     which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available
                 in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed
                Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides.
                 Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python 
                 programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, 
                 when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't
                  catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows 
                  inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints,
                   stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself,
                    testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug 
                    a program is to add a few print statements to the source:
                 the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective</p>

            <p>Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information 
                in a relational database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and
                 columns representing
                 different data attributes and the various relationships between the data values.</p>
