        <p>The internet existed in earlier times, but there were basic command-line programs that were more 
            challenging to operate. In that scenario, no standard language for the web. But the invention of HTML 
            language has provided users with much ease.Moreover, this language is much easier to learn and implement</p>

            <h1>A Brief History of HTML</h1>
        <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many 
            different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, 
            which became an official standard in December 1999
            Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language
            that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML
            (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these 
            languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications
            . This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML
            version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 
            2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary 
            for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be
            impossible</p>

        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML is a Hypertext Markup language that is an essential component of the internet. 
            It is not a programming language. This markup language is utilized to make web pages. 
            HTML can be compared to the layout, design, or skeleton of a web page. The entire web page
             is constructed from HTML building blocks or elements.</p>

        <h3>HTML Elements (HTML building blocks)</h3>
        <p>HTML building blocks are known as HTML tags or elements. 
            An element instructs the browser how to display a web pages specific section</p>
